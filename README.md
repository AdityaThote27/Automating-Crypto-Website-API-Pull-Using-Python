# Automating-Crypto-Website-API-Pull-Using-Python
In this project we look at automating this API pull as well as cleaning up the data a little bit. Then we create a visualization for the same.
This project uses the Api key from https://coinmarketcap.com/ and gives us info about the latest crypto trends.
Also Stores the info in a .csv file. Make sure to make the changes in file path :)
